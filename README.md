# The-Gaming-Room
My software design and project reflections for The Gaming Room client project

The client, The Gaming Room, needed a cross-platform version of their game “Draw It or Lose It”, so it could be played smoothly across different operating systems and devices like iOS, Windows, or Linux. I made sure to organize all the documents clearly and cover every requirement, paying close attention to system architecture and user needs. Creating the design document upfront really helped me map out the project before jumping into code, which made the whole process easier and helped me avoid mistakes. It pretty much acted as a blueprint that I could keep coming back to. 

If I could revise one part of my work on these documents, I would like to further develop the codebase itself. By expanding and refining the underlying logic, I could enhance functionality, improve performance, and address any areas that may need further improvement. When it comes to interpreting user’s needs, I always try to look at things from the user’s perspective, which I think is super important to make sure the final product is actually useful and meets the user’s expectations. For my approach I broke down the requirements, researched best practices, and drew up diagrams to try and visualize the system, and as for future projects, I would like to seek more feedback from users earlier in the process to better ensure users are satisfied with the end results.
